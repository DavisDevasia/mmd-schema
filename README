The MusicBrainz XML Metadata Schema
-----------------------------------

This directory contains the official RELAX NG schema for the
MusicBrainz XML Metadata format (MMD) and several sample files
that can serve as test cases. MMD has been designed to represent
music metadata and is used by the MusicBrainz web service.

Some older versions of the schema are included, too, but only
schema/musicbrainz_mmd-2.0.rng is the official, current version.

Documentation and the latest revision can be found at

        http://musicbrainz.org/development/mmd/


Questions about this format should be posted to the MusicBrainz
forums (http://community.metabrainz.org) or brought up on the 
#metabrainz IRC channel on Freenode.
